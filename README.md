# MY MOST AMBITIOUS PROJECT YET
It is an understatement when I say I was definitely punching above my weight class for this project. This was the first time I dived extremely deep into backend development and it was certainly an uphill battle. On countless occassions, I wondered if I could even do this? Thankfully, in the end, I pulled through and developed it. That said, there are bugs here and there which I will fix on a later date (DAMN YOU POSTMAN 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR)!

## DETAILS
- MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) Full Stack build
- Firebase as host
- React for designing whatsapp clone UI
- Used MUI for the icons
- Postman to create the API
- ExpressJS for the web framework
- MongoDB as database
- NodeJS for server-side scripting
- Used Pusher as the host real-time API service

## DRAWBACKS
- I have not set up any system to let users from different accounts chat with each other
- Postman's 500 Internal server error is very common and I still have not learned how to overcome it
- Poor graphical user interface (users cannot change pictures, groupchat names, create groupchats, etc)
- Quite literally, this build can only send and store messages, and then, get those stored messages back to be displayed on the user's interface

## TAKEAWAYS
- Get better a fullstack by learning more about MERN and executing more projects (maybe take on smaller, bite-sized projects instead?)

## SHOUT-OUTS
I WOULD LOVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS VIDEO:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
